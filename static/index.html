			<h4>Creating a community for collaborative storytelling.</h4>
			<p>
				Imagine a story curated by the internet, chapter by chapter. 
				<br/><br/>
				Novelly is a new way to write a story by crowdsourcing chapters generated by users. With the minds of different disciplines and morals, we can create absurd and expansive worlds. The goal of this application is to have each chapter voted by the users and ultimately create a unique narrative.
				<br/><br/>
				Share your knowledge. Share your stories. <i>Novelly is in development...</i>
