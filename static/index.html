			<h4>Creating a community for collaborative storytelling.</h4>
			<p>
				Imagine a novel curated by the internet, chapter by chapter. 
				<br/><br/>
				Let us reimagine storytelling. Let us share stories, ideas, characters, experiences. 
				<br/><br/>
				Novelly is an application where writers are able to make a contribution in creating a shared novel. It doesn't matter if you're an established author, a programmer, a chef, or even a pre-schooler. Our mission is to create a writing format that allows everyone to commit to a story that is much more expansive and unique with the minds of people from many different disciplines. 
				<br/><br/>
				Share your knowledge. Share your stories. Let us see how deep this rabbit hole can go.
